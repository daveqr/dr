# Readme

## Requirements

This library requires the following:

* Java 8
* Maven 3

## Installation

Clone the project from GitHub.

    $ git clone https://github.com/daveqr/dr.git
    $ git checkout ex-2

## Usage
From the project directory, run:

    $ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.davedaniels.dr.Main"

## Running Tests
From the project directory, run:

    $ mvn test

## Assumptions

* The assumptions for ex-1 are true for ex-2.
* In a real-world situation, I would have clarified some of the requirements with the customer.

## Limitations

The code for ex-2 is not all that different than ex-1, so the same limitations hold.
